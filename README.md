# Tank-Trouble
Tank Trouble is a fast-paced local multiplayer tank battle game where players control tanks in an arena, navigating obstacles and firing projectiles to destroy opponents. The goal is simple: outmanoeuvre and shoot rivals to be the last tank standing. It’s easy to pick up, competitive, and full of chaotic fun.

# Tank Trouble — Controls  

## Overview  
Tank Trouble is a two-player local multiplayer game where both players share a single keyboard.  
Each player controls a tank using **tank-style controls**:  

- **Forward/Backward** keys move the tank in the direction it’s facing.  
- **Left/Right** keys rotate the tank.  
- **Fire** launches a shell in the direction the turret faces.  

Projectiles have a **cooldown** between shots, meaning you cannot spam fire — timing your shots is as important as aiming.

- This prevents constant rapid fire and adds a layer of **strategy** — players must choose the right moment to shoot.

## Quick Tips  
- **Use walls to your advantage** — shells can bounce off walls, letting you hit opponents indirectly.  
- **Don’t waste your cooldown** — missing a shot leaves you vulnerable until your weapon reloads.  
- **Stay mobile** — a moving target is harder to hit.  
- **Mind splash damage** — even near-misses can deal chip damage if you’re too close.  
- **Play your tank’s strengths** — smaller tanks excel at dodging, larger ones at area control.
